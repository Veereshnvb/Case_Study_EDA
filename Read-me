## General Information
- This project conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to loan information, analyzing patterns and trends within the data.
- The background of the project involves understanding key factors that impact loan approval and repayment, with the goal of making informed business decisions regarding loan management.
- The business problem being addressed is improving loan approval processes and identifying risks associated with loan defaults.
- The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from a CSV file (loan.csv) containing various records of loans, including key features like loan amount,   applicant details, and loan status.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1: Credit Grade: Applicants in grades B, C, and D are significantly more likely to default.
- Conclusion 2: Sub-Grade Risk: Higher default rates are observed in sub-grades B3, B4, B5, and C1.
- Conclusion 3: Employment Length: Applicants with 10+ years of employment are more prone to default.
- Conclusion 4: Geographic Factors: Higher default rates are concentrated in states CA, FL, and NJ.
- Conclusion 5: Housing Situation: Renters and mortgaged homeowners are at greater risk of defaulting.
- Conclusion 6: Income Level: Lower annual income correlates with higher default likelihood.
- Conclusion 7: Interest Rates: Default risk increases with rising interest rates.
